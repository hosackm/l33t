# l33t

A place for me to store my leetcode solutions and work.

## Scope

I'm working off a subset of problems from [leetcode](leetcode.com) as chosen by the author of [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

My solutions will be done mostly in Python as that's the language I'd most likely choose to interview in. However, I'll occasionally solve problems in other languages when it suits the problem or if I'm curious to see how the solution would differ (ie. Go, Zig, C).
